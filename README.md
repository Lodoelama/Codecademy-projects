## Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.

In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

**Please note: Projects do not run tests against your code. This experience is more open to your interpretation and gives you the freedom to explore. Remember that all variables must be declared before they are referenced in your code.

## Sal's Shipping
Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.

In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.

Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
Here are the prices:

Ground Shipping

Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
2 lb or less	$1.50	$20.00
Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$3.00	$20.00
Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$4.00	$20.00
Over 10 lb	$4.75	$20.00

Ground Shipping Premium

Flat charge: $125.00

Drone Shipping

Weight of Package	Price per Pound	Flat Charge
2 lb or less	$4.50	$0.00
Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	$9.00	$0.00
Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	$12.00	$0.00
Over 10 lb	$14.25	$0.00

Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.
